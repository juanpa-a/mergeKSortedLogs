     * A LogEntry is simply an object of the form:
     * {
     * 		date: Date,
     * 		msg: String,
     * }
     *
     * All LogEntries from a given LogSource are guaranteed to be popped in chronological order.
     * Eventually a LogSource will end and return boolean false.
     *
     * Your job is simple: print the sorted merge of all LogEntries across `n` LogSources.
     *
     * Call `printer.print(logEntry)` to print each entry of the merged output as they are ready.
     * This function will ensure that what you print is in fact in chronological order.
     * Call 'printer.done()' at the end to get a few stats on your solution!
